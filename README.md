#### Note

The only purpose of this repository is to provide a basic Docker compose file with basic requirements for a simple WordPress installation.

#### Usage

Running `docker-compose up -d` should be enough to build, re/create, and start the containers in the background and leave them running.

After successfully running `docker-compose up -d`:

* The WordPress site can be accessed via http://localhost:8080.
* PHPMyAdmin can be accessed via http://localhost:8181
